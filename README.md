## Installation

For this task we need to unstall the VS Code programm to write the code. Also the Dev Tools in Google Chrome browser will come very useful to test the application. In the file structure is very simple and lightweigt. The application is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages. It containes 2 pages with users interface, one with styles and two pages with the script, responsible for the functionality. 

## Usage

When the user opens the application, he will be greated and presented with a Start button, that launches the function, that brings on the screen a series of questions with 4 buttons for answer choices. The countdown starts at 75 seconds. If a question is answered wrong, a 10-second penalty will be sunstracted from the timer. If a question is answered correctly, the application will give a message "Correct!".<br>
When all questions are answered or the countdown reaches 0, the quiz will end and the user will be able to save his initials and the current score. On every page, there's a link to conveniently access the scoreboard at any point of the quiz.
<br>
The interface of the program is simple and intuitive and very much resembles the provided design examples. The application is very light - under 1 megabite, so it will be fast and easy to execute. It runs smoothly, with no errors in the console and the initials and the scores are stored locally within the user's browser, and can be accessed anytime, unless the user will decide to clear the board and start over.
<br>
The application is launched at a live URL. The repository has an easy to navigate structure. Every file containes discriptive comments and follows the best practices of naming conventions.
